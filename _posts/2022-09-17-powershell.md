# A Quick Introduction to Powershell Commands

Powershell is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It allows you to perform a wide range of tasks, such as managing local and remote servers, automating tasks, and creating custom scripts.

Here are a few basic Powershell commands that you should know:

<table>

      <col width="10%" />
      <col width="20%" />
      <col width="70%" />

         <th>Command</th>
         <th>Usage</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>

      <tr>
         <td>1.</td>
         <td>Get-Command</td>
         <td>This cmdlet displays a list of all available Powershell cmdlets. You can use the "-Module" parameter to display only the cmdlets in a specific module, and the "-Verb" parameter to display only cmdlets with a specific verb.</td>
