I"<p>A downloadable task file is given with this challenge. It contains an image as shown below. <img src="/assets/WindowsXP.jpg" alt="WindowsXP.jpg" />
On running exiftool, we find the name of a person <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OWoodflint</code>.
<img src="/assets/ohsint-exiftool.png" alt="exiftool" />
A quick google search gives us a twitter account, where the person has shared a BSSID.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>From my house I can get free wifi ;D<br />
Bssid: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41 - Go nuts!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On going to wigle.net/ and typing the BSSID into advanced search, we get the personâ€™s location and SSID.</p>

<p>Going back to google search of OWoodflint, we get the github account and a wordpress blog. In github we get his email ID. From the blog we get his holiday location and password.</p>
